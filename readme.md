# Advent of Rust 🦀 🎄

This repository contains my solutions for the **[Advent of Rust](https://www.rustfinity.com/advent-of-rust)** challenges hosted by Rustfinity.

Advent of Rust is a series of 25 daily coding challenges designed to sharpen Rust programming skills through festive, Christmas-themed problems. Each day focuses on different aspects of the Rust language, ranging from basic syntax and types to more advanced concepts like traits, error handling, and memory management.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a single Rust package with solutions organized by day:

- `src/main.rs`: The main entry point that modules all the daily solutions.
- `src/day01.rs` to `src/day16.rs`: Individual modules containing the implementation and tests for each day's challenge.
